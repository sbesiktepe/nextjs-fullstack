# Next.js E-Commerce App with Authentication, Redux, Prisma, and Local Storage

This is a full-stack e-commerce web application built with Next.js. The project includes user authentication using `next-auth` for easy integration with various authentication providers. Form management is handled efficiently with `react-hook-form`. Local storage is utilized for client-side data persistence, Redux for global state management, and Prisma for efficient database access.
Visual design was not targeted in this project, the basic structure of an e-commerce site was created in the frontend and backend using next-js and the specified structures.
